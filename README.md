The Gender Pay Gap Hack is a collaboration between the [AI Club for Gender Minorities](https://www.meetup.com/ai-club/), [codebar](https://codebar.io/), and [Ellpha Citizen](https://www.ellpha.com/) to use data science to discover new insights about the [UK's Gender Pay Gap Data](https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/viewing/download). 


The UK government has a [beta service for searching the gender pay gap data](https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/).
